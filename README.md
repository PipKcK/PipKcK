# Hey there 👋

I'm Ujjwal, a Security Engineer and AI builder.

I break systems, secure them, and build intelligent ones.

Most of my work sits at the intersection of cybersecurity and applied AI.

Right now, I’m building a Blockchain based Identity System focused on decentralized authentication and verifiable credentials.

On the side, I ship tools:
- A Web3 browser extension powered by yt-dlp
- Privacy focused local file conversion utilities
- GenAI endpoints hosted on AWS Lambda for Sayaam For All
- Open source contributions to projects like OneCommunity

My main stack is Python, Linux, AWS, and security tooling.
I regularly work with Wireshark, Burp Suite, Metasploit, Nmap, Snort, Hugging Face, Ollama, and LangChain.

I enjoy network traffic analysis, offensive security testing, LLM deployment, and building secure AI pipelines.

If something can be automated, optimized, or hardened, I’m probably working on it.
