# Welcome to my Humble Abode 👋

I'm Ujjwal — a Security Engineer who wandered into AI and decided to stay.

I spend most of my time breaking systems, understanding why they break, and then rebuilding them stronger. My work lives at the intersection of cybersecurity and applied AI, where things get interesting fast.

Right now, I’m building a (POC) Blockchain based Identity System focused on decentralized authentication and verifiable credentials. The goal is simple: make identity more secure, more private, and less dependent on centralized trust.

When I’m not working on that, I’m usually building and shipping tools:

- A Web3 browser extension powered by yt-dlp  
- Privacy focused local file conversion utilities  
- Security and automation focused experimental projects

## 🤝 Volunteer Work

Alongside my personal projects, I contribute to mission driven organizations:

**Sayaam For All**  
Hosting and maintaining GenAI endpoints on AWS Lambda. Working on scalable inference pipelines and reliable API infrastructure.

**OneCommunity**  
Contributed to OneCommunity's codebase by identifying and fixing bugs, improving stability and maintainability.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

My core stack revolves around **Python, Linux, and AWS**.

On the security side, I work heavily with **Wireshark, Burp Suite, Metasploit, Nmap, and Snort**.

On the AI side, I build with **Azure/AWS, Hugging Face, Ollama, and LangChain** to deploy and orchestrate LLM driven systems.

I enjoy network traffic analysis, offensive testing, model deployment, and designing systems that are both intelligent and hardened.

If something can be automated, optimized, or secured properly, I’m probably already experimenting with it.

Fun facts:

- I enjoy CTFs and reverse engineering challenges  
- I like building tools more than talking about them  
- I am statistically better than 95% of all humans at chess
